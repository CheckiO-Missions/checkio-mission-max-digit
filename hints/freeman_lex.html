            The general idea is to "break" number into separate digits and then choose
            the biggest among them.

            Use build-in <a target="_blank" href="https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_func_str.asp">str()</a>
            function to convert input number into string.
            <br />
            <br />
            <pre class="brush: python">
    a = 12
    a = str(a)
    print(a)
    
    # output:
    # 12 looks the same, but it's string now :-)

            Done. But don't know how to proceed.
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
            The next step is to use build-in <a target="_blank" href="https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_func_map.asp">map()</a>
            function, which implements specific function to each element of sequence.
            In this case, you need to convert each character of created string back into
            integer.
            <br />
            <br />
            <pre class="brush: python">
    a = map(int, str(a))        
            </pre>
            The result is map object. If you convert it into list, you see:
            <br />
            <br />
            <pre class="brush: python">
    print(list(a))

            Use build-in <a target="_blank" href="https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_func_max.asp">max()</a> function
            to find maximum element in sequence. This function can take map object as
            its argument. No need to convert into list.
            <br />
            <br />
            <pre class="brush: python">

            So, how my final solution should look like?
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
            You just need to wrap code into function expression and return result of
            max() function. Here is the code:
            <br />
            <br />
            <pre class="brush: python">
    def max_digit(a: int) -> int:
    
        return max(map(int, str(a)))        
            </pre>
            This function is simple and short so you may use lambda expression (anonymous function)
            to write such functions more compact.
            <br />
            <br />
            <pre class="brush: python">
    max_digit = lambda a: max(map(int, str(a)))        
            </pre>
        </div>
    </div>

            This solution uses even less functions, but is less obvious. When you 
            implement max() to string without specific sorting key, characters are sorted with lexicographical order,
            where characters from "0" to "9" are sorted the same way as digits from 0 to 9. 
            <br />
            <br />
            <pre class="brush: python">
    max_digit = lambda a: int(max(str(a)))
            </pre>
            If you have any doubts, here is detailed step-by-step solution.
            <br />
            <br />
            <pre class="brush: python">
    def max_digit(a: int) -> int:
    
        current_max = 0
        for num in str(a):
            num = int(num)
            if num > current_max:
                current_max = num
    
        return current_max
            </pre>
